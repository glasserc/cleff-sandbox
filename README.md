A playground to mess around with `cleff` and get some experience with effect systems.

A bunch of docs exist in the `docs/` directory.

This repo has a bare minimum of Nix set up but the main tooling expected to be used is `stack`.

To build:

```
stack build
```

To run:

```
stack run
```

To run tests:

```
stack test
```
